This repository includes projects that I completed for my Machine Learning class

All of these projects are essentially the same project with each iteration building
off of the last. The most complete of the projects are assignment 3 and assignment 5.
(As you will see, there is no assignment 4 because assignment 4 was to fix up assignment 3)

These projects all attempt to measure the same outcome:

If a teacher tries to fund a project through a crowdfunding website, will
the teacher receive funding within 60 days?
