Problem 3: Analysis and Communication

1: How has crime changed from 2017 to 2018?
In 2017 there were 268,093 total crimes reported
In 2018 there were 266,232 total crimes reported
This is a 0.69% reduction in the reported number of crimes

2: More granular analysis of how crime has changed

A: Are the Alderman's statistics correct?
i: Compare data from 2017 and 2018 in July
ia: Robberies
	2017: 1004
	2018: 876
	Drop of 12.7%
ib: Aggravated batteries
	2017: 4702
	2018: 4881
	Rose 3.8%
ic: Burglaries
	2017: 1206
	2018: 1139
	Drop of 5.56%
id: Motor Vehicle Theft
	2017: 991
	2018: 865
	Drop of 12.7%
ie: Crime since 2017 has actually dropped, not risen by 10%
if: We do not have the 2016 data

B: Do I agree with the conclusions?
No, I think these statements are misleading and I think the Alderman has a political agenda. Most of the crimes listed have actually dropped overall.

3: Key Crime Findings
Reported crimes are falling
Theft and battery are the two types of crime that have the largest number of calls

4: Caveats
This is all based on the reported crimes, not necessarily the total amount of crime.
The crime rate is subject to change and you should keep an eye on this.

Problem 3: (Statistics)

A:

B:

C:
GP: 600
GP Batter: 100
GP Battery % = 100 / 600 = 16.6%

Up: 400
Up Battery: 160
Up Battery % = 160 / 400 = 40.0%

Total GP Battery % = 100 / 1000 = 10%
Total Up Battery % = 160 / 1000 = 16%

There is a 6% greater chance that a call about battery will come from Uptown than the chance that it will come from Garfield Park.
